## What is Quadravox?
 
Quadravox is a unique composition tool that allows you to manipulate up to four voices based on the chosen key and timing interval. You can control the level, pan, delay, and pitch of each voice independently, as well as the type of musical interval. You can also sync the effect to your DAW tempo for perfect timing.
 
Quadravox is based on the technology from Eventide's flagship H8000FW studio processor, which is used by many professional artists and producers. It works great on monophonic synths, guitar, vocals, and even drums. It comes with more than 60 presets to inspire your songwriting and sound design.
 
## How to Use Quadravox?
 
Using Quadravox is easy and intuitive. You can simply load it as a plugin on your track and start playing with the parameters. Here are some basic steps to get you started:
 
1. Select a key and scale from the drop-down menus at the top of the plugin window. This will determine the pitch of the four voices relative to the input signal.
2. Select a timing interval from the grid below the key and scale menus. This will determine the delay time of each voice relative to the input signal. You can choose from different note values, dotted notes, triplets, or custom values.
3. Adjust the level, pan, feedback, and detune knobs for each voice as desired. You can also click on the voice number buttons to mute or solo each voice.
4. Use the mix knob at the bottom right corner of the plugin window to blend the wet and dry signals. You can also use the mix lock button to keep the mix level constant as you scroll through presets or snapshots.
5. Use the randomize button at the bottom left corner of the plugin window to add some variation and natural character to each voice. You can also use the key lock button to keep the key and scale constant as you scroll through presets or snapshots.

You can also use the notation grid to place notes over time in a more musical way. The grid shows pitches on a traditional music staff with a quantized grid for placing notes over time. The color and brightness indicate pan and level for each voice. You can drag and drop notes on the grid or use your mouse wheel to change their pitch.
